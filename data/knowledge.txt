Ghana's Constitution is the country's supreme law, adopted in 1992 through a national referendum with 92% approval. It was approved on 28 April 1992 through a national referendum after 92% support and defines the fundamental political principles of the Republic of Ghana.

The Constitution establishes the structure, procedures, powers and duties of government, outlining how state authority should be exercised. The Sovereignty of Ghana resides in the people of Ghana in whose name and for whose welfare the powers of government are to be exercised within the limits set by the Constitution itself.

As the supreme law, the Constitution takes precedence over all other laws in Ghana. It serves as the foundation for Ghana's democratic governance system, defining the rights of citizens, the separation of powers between different branches of government, and the framework for how the country should be governed. The 1992 Constitution marked Ghana's transition to democratic rule after periods of military governance and remains the current constitutional framework governing the nation.
